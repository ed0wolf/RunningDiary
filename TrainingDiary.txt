             12min cool down
             (Super windy and rains meant the times fluctuated pretty wildley. Lost focus early on due to wind 
              but regained focus to end with 4-5 really good 73-77s intervals with the wind and rain still gusting.)

          10-15min cool down + stretching
          (Weather outside was attrocious. Decided to 'do a Galen' and do a session indoors on the treatmill.
           Was apretty good session, it forced me to runn consistently at a high tempo rather than surging as I
           would on a track. FYI: 18.5 Km/h = 3:14 Min/Km )

          (Had to call it a day early, was late for a meeting. A really good set of initial 400ms but couldn't 
          hold the pace for the whole distance. Yet more proof of my lack of fitness.)
