             (Super windy and rains meant the times fluctuated pretty wildley. Lost focus early on due to wind

          (Weather outside was attrocious. Decided to 'do a Galen' and do a session indoors on the treatmill.
           Was apretty good session, it forced me to runn consistently at a high tempo rather than surging as I
           would on a track. FYI: 18.5 Km/h = 3:14 Min/Km )
